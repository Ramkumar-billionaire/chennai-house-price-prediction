# PROBLEM STATEMENT : 

In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate price for a property is crucial for property owners, 
and property management companies. Accurate price predictions can help landlords set competitive prices
, and property management companies optimize their portfolio management.
The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven model that predicts the price of house based on relevant features.
By analyzing historical data and property attributes, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable price predictions

# TOOLS & PACKAGES USED :
       1. Pandas
       2. Numpy
       3. MatplotLib
       4. Seaborn
       5. ScikitLearn
       6. Jupyter NoteBook
# SUMMARY :

  After importing the CSV file, convert it into a dataframe. 
  Then, clean the unstructured and imbalanced data to create a structured format. 
  Perform data cleansing, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
  Finally, utilize the scikit-learn library to build machine learning algorithms. 
  Determine feature importance using XGBoost's feature_importance function.
  Finally, suggest the important features that affects the price value.
